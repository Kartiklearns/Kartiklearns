## Hi there 👋

I’m Kartik, a fullstack dev based in India.

I am a Law student too. 

I am doing Fullstack development as to learn something new and replace my addiction for gaming.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll try and learn how to build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is MERN, I also know basic Python and C


Fun Facts:
- I love learning more about nerdy stuff
- I don’t like coffee or tea
- One Piece is my favorite anime
- Berserk is my favourite manga
- I fucking love ELDEN RING
  
Hobbies: anime, gym, reading
